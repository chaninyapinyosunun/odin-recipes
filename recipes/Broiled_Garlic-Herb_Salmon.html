        <h3><p>It is a broiled salmon, easy enough for a beginner and delicious if done right. This salmon goes great with red potatoes and some steamed veggies.</p></h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>2 (5 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets</p>
        <p>⅓ cup olive oil</p>
        <p>1 lemon, halved, divided</p>
        <p>⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley</p>
        <p>⅓ cup chopped fresh oregano</p>
        <p>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</p>
        <p>4 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon kosher salt, divided</p>
        <p>6 lemon slices</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong> Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong> Pour oil into a medium bowl. Rinse salmon fillets and pat dry. Dip fillets into oil, being sure to coat both sides, and place skin-side down into the prepared baking pan. Squeeze as much juice as you can from 1 lemon half over the fillets. Coat both sides of salmon with parsley, oregano, basil, and garlic, and sprinkle with 1/2 of the kosher salt.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong> Place under the preheated broiler and cook until center is light pink and edges are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong> Remove fillets from the oven and immediately plate. Squeeze remaining lemon half over top and sprinkle with remaining kosher salt. Serve with lemon slices.
